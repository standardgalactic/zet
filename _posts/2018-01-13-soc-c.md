title: Making parallelism explicit with SoC-C
---

Last week's [S-REPLS
keynote](http://soft-dev.org/events/srepls8/abstracts.html#keynote) by [Sylvan
Clebsch](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/syclebsc/) was a talk
about the limitations of current microprocessor architecture and how it hides
everything of interest from the programmer: instruction level parallelism is
hidden behind out-of-order execution, message passing is hidden behind cache
coherency, etc.  This reminded me that I have been meaning to write about the
[SoC-C]({{ site.url }}/papers/CASES_08/) project that aimed to make parallelism
explicit by adding some language extensions to C and that achieved very high
performance, good scaling and high energy efficiency by using compiler tricks
and some programmer annotations to let us exploit a fairly bare-bones parallel
system.

## The Ardbeg Software Defined Radio Project

SoC-C was one part of a larger project to develop an LTE software defined radio
that could be used in a 4G mobile phone or wireless baseband station.
I think Ardbeg had 50 people working on it at it's peak and it consisted of 5
strands:

 * Design a really really fast, really really energy-efficient digital signal processor (DSP) that can
   do all the hard work.
   The DSP was described in [this paper]({{ site.url }}/papers/MICRO_08/).
 * Figure out how to program the DSP without tearing your hair out.
 * Design a radio sub-system containing multiple DSP engines each with
   their own private instruction and data memory, add some DMA engines to copy
   data and code from one engine to another and send/receive data from the
   digital frontend, add some specialized units to do
   error correction and add a control processor to drive the whole thing.
 * Figure out how to program the radio sub-system without tearing your hair
   out.
   This was described in [this paper]({{ site.url }}/papers/CASES_08/).
 * Read a stack of LTE protocol specifications and figure out how to implement
   the LTE physical layer efficiently.

All this had to fit into the power and area budget of existing custom ASIC
solutions so instead of just building the hardware and then letting the
software folks figure out how to use it, this was a giant co-design exercise:
if the software needed a particular instruction, the hardware folk would look
at how to add it; if the hardware folk said that some instruction was too
power/area hungry, the software folk would see whether they could survive
without it.
There was a lot of arguing.

I was lucky enough to be one of the first few people on the project when we
were making the initial design decisions and before we had split into separate
teams.  So I worked on parts of the vector instruction set supported by the
DSPs, I worked on the programming model for the DSPs, I wrote some of the first
few "kernels" for the DSPs, I built the system simulator.  But mostly, I worked
on the programming model for the whole subsystem.

I also came up with the name "Ardbeg"  based on the idea that when the team
went to the pub we would be sure to get in a round of my favourite whisky.
Unfortunately, I had not noticed that none of the Cambridge pubs stocked
"Ardbeg" so this was a lot less successful than I had planned.
However, the idea caught on and for the next few years almost every research
project at Arm was named after a whisky (or whiskey in our US office).


## Building an Energy Efficient System

There is no real secret to building energy efficient, high performance
hardware.  You keep the clock rate low, use massive amounts of parallelism to
compensate, split the memory into many small parts scattered across the system,
avoid any unnecessary communication such as cache snooping and
avoid all forms of speculation.
General purpose CPUs generally don't do this: they emphasize
single-thread performance over energy efficiency because most software has not
been parallelized.
(Actually, I lie.  There are a lot of secrets to low energy design.  Most
engineers pick them up slowly over a decade or so of working on low energy
designs.  For example, by working at Arm.)

The system we came up with looked a bit like this diagram (taken from
[this paper]({{ site.url }}/papers/CASES_08/)).

This shows a control processor (GPP) in the top left, the SIMD DSP engines on the right,
everything has its own memory (in fact, everything typically had 2
memories: an instruction memory and a data memory).
And, since we don't have cache coherence to "automatically" move data from one
processor's memory to the next, we have to explicitly copy data between
memories.  Just the task of running a program on one of the DSP engines
consisted of copying code into the instruction memory, copying constant tables
into the data memory, copying the inputs into the data memory, telling
the DSP what instruction to start at, waiting for the DSP to send an interrupt
indicating that the program had finished and then copying the result from the
data memory to whichever processor will use it next.
To handle all this copying, there are a lot of DMA engines.

## Programming the Radio Subsystem

The job of the control processor is to run tasks in the appropriate order and
with as much parallelism as possible.
The whole system is interrupt driven so the processor is constantly receiving
interrupts signalling completion of one task (or a timer or ...) in response to
which it would start DSP tasks and DMA transfers.
This is not an easy task.
Worse, if you wanted to try mapping tasks to DSPs
in a different way or if the hardware changed then you would have to rip up the
current choreography and start again.
There's a reason that modern general purpose, out-of-order processors work so
hard to hide the parallelism from you!

What we needed was a simple programming model that let you program at a high
level but provide some hints about how you wanted the program to run.  What I
came up with was an extension of C that added

 * compiler managed distributed shared memory
 * remote procedure calls
 * pipeline parallelism and fork-join parallelism

And, to keep the annotation burden low, I added annotation inference: using
the annotations you had already added to infer additional annotations.  This
worked really well because there were so many private memories so once you had
picked which processor was processing some data, there was no choice about
which memory that data had to live in.

### Compiler managed distributed shared memory

[Distributed Shared
Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_shared_memory) makes
a fragmented memory behave like a shared memory by arranging to copy data from
one processor's memory to another whenever the other processor needs it.  These
decisions are usually made on demand at runtime: a processor checks whether the
data is in its local memory and sends a request to obtain a copy if not (just
like a cache).  But those tests add overhead and fetching data on demand adds
latency so, instead, I required the programmer to indicate when they want to
synchronize one copy with another and used static analysis to figure out
whether there were any missing syncs and used annotation inference to figure
out which copies to perform.

Here is how we define where variables are to be placed in memory:

```c
complex_t samples[2048]  @ {GlobalMem, DMem1, DMem2};
complex_t freqs[2048]    @ {DMem2};
byte_t    FIR_code[]     @ {GlobalMem, IMem1};
byte_t    FFT_code[]     @ {GlobalMem, IMem2};
byte_t    FFT_twiddles[] @ {GlobalMem, DMem2};
```

This declares four variables "samples," "freqs," "FIR_code" and "FFT_code" and says that copies of
them can be placed in both the global memory and in "DMem1," "DMem2," "IMem1"
and "IMem2" (which are the private data and instruction memories of "DSP1" and
"DSP2."  The "FIR_code" and "FFT_code" variables will hold the binary code for the FIR
and FFT functions and "FFT_twiddles" will hold a table of constants used by the
FFT function.

And here is some of the code from the SDR receiver.  Notice that we reuse the
"@" annotations to specify where each function should run. This is basically
a remote procedure call invocation.

```c
SYNC(FIR_code)      @ DMA1;         // copy code for FIR filter into DSP engine
SYNC(FFT_code)      @ DMA1;         // copy code for FFT into DSP engine
SYNC(FFT_twiddles)  @ DMA1;         // copy FFT data tables into DSP engine
...
while(1) {
    ADC_get(&adc, &samples, 2048);  // read 2048 samples from ADC
    SYNC(samples)       @ DMA1;     // copy data into DSP engine
    FIR(samples)        @ DSP1;     // Apply FIR filter to samples
    SYNC(samples)       @ DMA3;     // copy samples from DMem1 to DMem2
    FFT(freqs, samples) @ DSP2;     // Apply FFT to samples, writing to freqs
    ...
}
```

This snippet shows us copying the code and constant tables from the global memory into
the instruction memories of the DSP engines before we start.  Then, inside the
loop, we read data from the analogue-to-digital convertor (ADC), sync those
samples (from the global memory to the DSP data memory), invoke the FIR
function on the samples, sync the samples over to the data memory of the other
DSP and invoke the FFT function on the second DSP.

In this case, I decided to run the FIR and the FFT tasks on separate
processors.  If I had decided to run them on the same processor, I would have
had to copy the code for the two functions into the instruction memory by
moving the SYNCs inside the loop.
And, if I had forgotten to do that, then the compiler would have warned me
that the ``FFT_code'' copy in the instruction memory was incoherent with the
copy in the global memory and needed to be reloaded.

The SoC-C compiler used the topology of the system to figure out that the ADC
writes into GlobalMem and DSP1 can only read from DMem1 so it could figure out
which direction to perform the DMA transfer although you can explicitly state
what is to be synced with what if you want.
In fact, half those annotations are redundant and can be omitted - I only put
them in to help explain what is executing where and on what.

Looking back on it, I could have inserted the SYNC automatically in most cases but
each copy was typically copying 4KB or 8KB of data and I wanted to be able to
reason about the performance impact and to be able to assign it to a suitable
DMA engine and parallelize it.  (I am not sure whether making the SYNC explicit
was a good decision - it didn't make quite enough difference to be able to
tell.)

### Pipeline parallelism

SoC-C let you explicitly define parallel threads and provided the usual set of
operations to communicate and synchronize between threads but it also provided
annotations that could specify how you wanted the compiler to parallelize the
code for you.
Our DSP engines provided 512-bit wide vector operations so we did not need to
express any more data parallelism but we did want to introduce pipeline
parallelism.  For example, in the above we might want a pipeline that is
fetching data from the ADC at the same time as it is filtering the previous
block of data at the same time as it is performing an FFT on the previous
previous block of data.

The way you request pipeline parallelism in SoC-C is to introduce a FIFO
to communicate between pipeline stages.

```c
pipeline {
    while(1) {
        ADC_get(&adc, &samples, 2048);

        FIFO(samples);

        SYNC(samples)       @ DMA1;
        FIR(samples)        @ DSP1;
        SYNC(samples)       @ DMA3;

        FIFO(samples);

        FFT(freqs, samples) @ DSP2;
        ...
    }
}
```

In this example, I thought that performing the FIR calculation would take less
time than the FFT calculation so I put the DMA transfers in the same thread as
the FIR.  If this turns out to be wrong, I can swap one of the SYNCs with the
FIFO to fix it.

The SoC-C compiler would take this code, perform a dataflow analysis and
realise that there were three independent pieces of code in this loop and then
it would split it into three separate threads like this:

```c
parallel_sections {
    section {
        while(1) {
            ADC_get(&adc, &samples, 2048);
            fifo_put(f1, samples);
        }
    }
    section {
        while(1) {
            fifo_get(f1, samples);
            SYNC(samples)       @ DMA1;
            FIR(samples)        @ DSP1;
            SYNC(samples)       @ DMA3;
            fifo_put(f2, samples);
        }
    }
    section {
        while(1) {
            fifo_get(f2, samples);
            FFT(freqs, samples) @ DSP2;
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

I am missing out some details about SYNC here - read [the paper]({{ site.url
}}/papers/CASES_08/) for a complete story.  This version of the code
(especially if I had shown you want happens with SYNC) is harder to read and is
a pain in the ass to maintain.

### From threads to interrupt handlers

But wait, didn't I tell you that this all had to be implemented with efficient,
low-latency interrupt handlers?  So what am I doing introducing threads
- surely those are going to add a lot of overhead?

The trick to making all the above run efficiently is to convert the code into
a bunch of state machines where each state corresponds to a point where
a thread has to wait for a DSP, DMA engine, timer, ADC, etc. to finish before
it can continue.  Associated with each state, there will be an interrupt
handling routine that clears the interrupt, performs a series of non-blocking
actions to communicate between threads, start tasks, etc. and then, just before
it finishes, it sets the interrupt handler for the next thing it has to wait
for.

For example this thread

```c
    while(1) {
        fifo_get(f1, samples);
        SYNC(samples)       @ DMA1;
        FIR(samples)        @ DSP1;
        SYNC(samples)       @ DMA3;
        fifo_put(f2, samples);
    }
```

performs four blocking actions (the first four lines) so it is transformed
into a state machine with four states.

1. The action for the first state is triggered when data arrives from the
   previous stage of the pipeline.  The action, starts the DMA transfer of
   samples from one memory to another, set the DMA1 interrupt handler to the
   action  for the second state and return from the interrupt.

2. The action for the second state is triggered when DMA1 completes.  It
   clears the interrupt, starts the FIR task on DSP1 and sets the DSP1
   interrupt handler to the handler for the third state.

I will leave it to your imagination to fill in the details for the other two
states, the other two receiver threads, the transmitter threads, other modes of
operation (e.g., initially connecting with the base station), etc.

### SoC-C manages tedious detail for the programmer

By now, you hopefully have a sense of how complicated the complete sequence of
tasks in this system is. The complete stack had around 20-30 different tasks
with DMA transfers between them and we were trying to make maximal use of our
four DSPs, six DMA engines and  Turbo accelerator.  And we had to meet
real-time requirements of processing the data quickly enough to meet protocol
requirements and to keep up with the data transfer rate of 20M samples per
second.

Doing this by hand would be horrendously complicated.
I could imagine implementing this once or twice without SoC-C by drawing out
all the state machines by hand, carefully reasoning about all the data
copies between machines, etc.  But I could not imagine trying lots of different
mappings onto the different processors - it would just be too much work.  So
my mapping would probably end up in some local optimum but it would be too much
work to try many different mappings in the hope of finding the global optimum.
And I would regard changes to the system hardware with dread.

The idea of SoC-C was to eliminate most of the tedious, error-prone details
from the task of mapping an algorithm onto the hardware.  The programmer was
still able/required to make the key decisions about the mapping but then SoC-C
filled in and expanded out all of the details.

## Conclusion

This post was inspired by [Sylvan Clebsch's](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/syclebsc/) talk about
how modern out-of-order microprocessors were hiding too much of the hardware's
raw parallel potential from the programmer.
I see SoC-C is one datapoint in an alternative design space where the
programmer can directly access that parallelism.

SoC-C was targetted at expert programmers who are willing to spend significant
time getting a small number of  very high value programs to run very
efficiently on hardware custom designed to run those programs.
The key idea was to let you add annotations to a portable program to customize
it for some platform.

Another point on the design space would be where the compiler automatically
decides how to map the program onto the hardware either based on heuristics
or based on a number of trial mappings.

Yet another point on the design space would change the hardware to be better
suited to general purpose workloads and use a JIT to decide how to map the
program onto the hardware.

There are many, many points and still, after more than 50 years of research
into parallel computing, I think very few of them have been explored.
