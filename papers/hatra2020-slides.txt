Tool specialization
  Allows better usability
  Enables optimization for purpose
  Tension: local optimization vs. global optimization
Decidability ceiling
  Tension: Predictability vs. power
  How to improve consistency?
  Profiling to find verification hotspots?

(our work is at an early stage)
Focus: payback within a week (stretch goal!!!)
