    All formal specifiers face the danger of overspecification:
    accidentally writing an overly restrictive specification.
    This problem is particularly acute for axiomatic specifications
    because it is so easy to write axioms that hold for some of the
    intended implementations but not for all of them (or, rather, it
    is hard not to write overly strong axioms).
    <p>
    One of the best developed ways of recovering some of these implementations
    which do not literally satisfy the specification is to apply a ``behavioural
    abstraction operator'' to a specification: adding in those implementations
    which have the same ``behaviour'' as an implementation which does satisfy
    the specification.
    <p>
    In two recent papers, Broy and Wirsing propose an alternative (and apparently
    simpler) approach which they call ``ultraloose specification.''  This approach
    is based on a particular style of writing axioms which avoids certain forms
    of overspecification.
    <p>
    An important, unanswered question is ``How does the ultraloose approach relate
    to other solutions?'' The major achievement of this thesis is a proof that the
    ultraloose approach is semantically equivalent to the use of the ``behavioural
    abstraction operator.''  This result is rather surprising in the light of a result
    by Schoett which seems to say that such a result is impossible.
