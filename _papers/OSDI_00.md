    Knit is a new component definition and linking language for
    systems code. Knit helps make C code more understandable and reusable by
    third parties, helps eliminate much of the performance overhead of
    componentization, detects subtle errors in component composition that
    cannot be caught with normal component type systems, and provides
    a foundation for developing future analyses over C-based components,
    such as cross-component optimization. The language is especially designed
    for use with component kits, where standard linking tools provide
    inadequate support for component configuration. In particular, we
    developed Knit for use with the OSKit, a large collection of
    components for building low-level systems. However, Knit is
    not OSKit-specific, and we have implemented parts of the
    Click modular router in terms of Knit components to
    illustrate the expressiveness and flexibility of our
    language. This paper provides an overview of the Knit
    language and its applications.
