I am a senior principal research engineer at Arm Ltd.
currently working on
[formal specification of the Arm processor architecture](/activities#mechanized-processor-specification).
My research at Arm revolves around the interplay between software, compilers, architecture and
microarchitecture in microprocessors.
This results in
[patents](/papers#patents),
[papers](/papers#papers)
and, most importantly, in tools that are used by Arm's processor and architecture teams.

My most influential project produced a methodology and tools for
[formal validation of Arm processors](/activities#processor-formal-verification)
against a 
[formal specification of Arm's processor architecture](/activities#mechanized-processor-specification).
The methodology and tools are in daily use by Arm's processor teams
and the specification has been [publicly released](/arm-v8_3/).

I was a founding member of Arm's team that developed the [Scalable Vector Extension](/activities#vector-processing):
a major new wide-vector instruction set that is used by
[Fujitsu's Post-K
supercomputer](http://www.fujitsu.com/global/Images/armv8-a-scalable-vector-extension-for-post-k.pdf).
I was a founding member of Arm's "Ardbeg"
[software defined radio project](/activities#software-defined-radio)
where I 
[created a language and compiler for programming heterogeneous parallel system](/activities#software-defined-radio).

I have also worked on
[vectorizing compilers](/activities#vectorizing-compiler-for-neon),
testcase generation,
architectural coverage analysis,
CPU simulators and the ARMv8 architecture.
Before working at Arm, I worked on
[functional programming](/activities#yale-university-projects),
and
[operating systems](/activities#university-of-utah-projects).
I hold over 20 [patents](/papers#patents),
have written over 20 peer reviewed [papers](/papers#papers).


I also like to
[build my own keyboards](/building-keyboards/).
