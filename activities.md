## Arm Ltd. Projects (selected)

I joined Arm Research in 2004 and initiate and lead research projects.  As
a supplier of commercial IP, we don't publish details of all our projects so
the following is only a selection.


### Mechanized Processor Specification

This was a very influential project to change the way that Arm thinks about
their processor specifications: how it creates them, how it validates them and
the many different ways that they can use them.

As a result of this work, the specification is executable instead of just being
a static document and we formally validate processor RTL against the
specification, generate parts of simulators, etc. from the specification,
and measure the architectural coverage of testsuites.
It is now standard practice for new architecture extensions
to be tested as they are being designed and for specifications to undergo
regression testing during maintenance.

Concurrently with the [Processor Verification](#processor-formal-verification)
project, I formalized the "pseudocode" that Arm uses to define their
processors; developed a toolchain to parse, typecheck and execute the
specifications; tested and fixed the pseudocode; and evangelized on the
benefits of having a single mechanized specification shared across the company.
The specifications, approach and tools are now in standard use across Arm's
engineering divisions and the specifications have been publicly released in
machine readable form.

This project has been an exercise in _soft power_:
showing the way,
building credibility and support,
paying and asking favours,
building a virtual team across the company,
understanding and overcoming [Conway's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law),
and exercising patience.
Changing Arm's use of the specification is only half the challenge;
the other half is helping the ecosystem to use the specification
so Arm has publicly released the mechanized v8-A architecture specification,
I have written papers about the creation, use and testing of the
specification
and I have gone to the USA, Germany, the UK, France, Austria,
and Italy [to give talks](/papers#talks) to industry,
to government agencies, to ``hacker'' conventions, to IETF and
theorem prover workshops,
and to universities about the potential uses of the specification.


3 architecture specifications mechanized,
3 major architecture extensions mechanized (TZM, SVE, Helium),
1 tool tech-transferred (in regular use by four Arm divisions),
3 papers published
([POPL 19](/papers/POPL_19/),
 [OOPSLA 17](/papers/OOPSLA_17/),
 [FMCAD 16](/papers/FMCAD_16/)),
1 architecture specification publicly released.


### Processor Formal Verification

This was a project to develop a flow to use Arm's architecture specifications
to formally validate Arm's processors and related IP.  This was the primary
motivation for the concurrent project on [mechanizing Arm's processor
specifications](#mechanized-processor-specification).

Working with verification engineers in Arm's processor division, I developed
the ISA-Formal processor verification technique that is based on:

- Machine generation of verification IP from Arm's official processor
  specification documents
- Using model checking for end-to-end verification of processor pipelines

This technique has proven very effective at detecting complex bugs early in the
design process.  It has been used on eight Arm processors and the tools and
technique will be used in all of Arm's next generation processors.

This project was a joy to work on: working with and learning to communicate
with subject experts, hard technical challenges and adoption of the techniques
by multiple project groups and by senior engineering management.

1 paper published ([CAV 16](/papers/CAV_16/)), 1 tool tech-transferred.


### Vector Processing

Building on the experience from [NEON](#vectorizing-compiler-for-neon) and from the
[Software Defined Radio](#software-defined-radio)
project, I spent some time working on how to make vector processing more
flexible and on how to implement it more efficiently.
This led to a major architecture extension known as the Scalable Vector
Extension (SVE) and to multiple architecture and
microarchitecture patents.

Since vector architecture projects always lead to large ISA extensions, I also
created a language and tool to describe large ISAs in a compact, structured
way and, of course,
I made sure that we had a [formal
specification](#mechanized-processor-specification).

Visiting the same topic three times within Arm has taught me a lot about how
to conduct an ISA extension project all the way from initial investigations
with dodgy, hacked-together tools through to a finished design with
benchmarking, assembler, compiler, OS, etc. support, with a formal ISA
specification, processor verification IP, testsuites, etc.
And, most importantly, how to get from those rough beginnings to a polished
design ready for processor teams to implement.

10 patents granted, 2 papers published ([IEEE
Micro 17](/papers/IEEE_Micro/), [DATE 14](/papers/DATE_14/)), 1 tool tech-transferred.


### Software Defined Radio

I led the team developing software tools for Arm's Software Defined Radio
platform. This included developing C language extensions to support
heterogeneous multiprocessors ('System-on-chip C' or just SoC-C), developing
the SoC-C compiler and linker and driving the specification of the toolchain
for individual processors. I also contributed to the initial design of the
Vector (SIMD) instructions for the DSP engine we developed and to both hardware
and software aspects of the trace generation system for low overhead monitoring
of parallel real-time systems. The platform has been spun out into another
company (Cognovo) which has since been acquired by u-blox.

1 working test chip, 8 patents granted, 4 papers published ([CASES 08](/papers/CASES_08/),
[MICRO 08](/papers/MICRO_08/),
[SIPS 06](/papers/SIPS_06/),
[SDR 06](/papers/SDR_06)), 3 tools released, 1 spinout company purchased,
numerous training sessions provided to potential customers.


### Thread Support

A chance discussion over coffee lead to an interesting idea on how to share
resources between hardware threads of different priorities. 

1 patent granted, 1 paper published ([SBAC-PAD 07](/papers/SBAC_PAD_07/)).


### Reliability/Security

Another team had developed an interesting circuit for running processors faster
by detecting and recovering from errors. This short project looked at how this
circuit could be used to detect that someone is tampering with the chip. 

1 patent granted.


### Parallel H.264 decoder

This project explored use of ideas from stream computation to structure
a parallel H.264 decoder. Observations of the difficulty handling control in
stream computation fed into the later development of SoC-C
(see [Software Defined Radio](#software-defined-radio) project).

1 patent filed.


### Vectorizing Compiler for NEON

I joined an existing hardware-software project developing Arm's Advanced SIMD
extensions (NEON). The software component was to improve/test/demonstrate the
design by showing that a vectorizing compiler could be written. My role was to
add floating point support and make the compiler robust enough for release to
partners. One of the nicest comments we received was that our prototype R&D
compiler was more reliable than many production quality commercial tools that
the partner uses.

1 tool released.

## University of Utah Projects

I joined the University of Utah's Flux research group in 1999 where I worked on
microkernels, component-based operating systems and embedded systems.

### Embedded Systems

I developed a variety of tools for analyzing embedded systems including
a binary analysis tool to identify which interrupts were enabled/disabled and
a worst-case stack-depth analysis (which accounted for interrupt-handlers).

4 papers published
([ASPLOS 04](/papers/ASPLOS_04),
[TECS 05](/papers/TECS_05),
[ACP4IS 03](/papers/ACP4IS_03/),
[EMSOFT 03](/papers/EMSOFT_03/)).

### Component-Based Operating Systems

I designed and implemented a component extension for C which could handle the
needs of low-level code with complex interconnections and even more complex
component initialization requirements. I used this to develop a more modular
version of the operating system toolkit 'OSKit' previously developed at Utah.

3 papers published
([OSDI 00](/papers/OSDI_00/),
[ASPSE 01](/papers/ASPSE_01/),
[ICSE 02](/papers/ICSE_02/)),
2 open source projects released.

## Yale University Projects

I joined Yale University's [Haskell](https://haskell.org/) research group in 1994.

### Robotics

I applied the principles of Functional Reactive Programming to the tasks of
Visual Tracking and Robotics.

2 papers published ([ICSE 99](/papers/ICSE_99/), [PADL 01](/papers/PADL_01/)).

### Haskell Compiler Development

I worked on the Yale Haskell Compiler, the Hugs (Haskell) Compiler, the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler, the standard Haskell libraries, graphics libraries, exception
handling and the foreign function interface.

6 papers published
([PLDI 99](/papers/PLDI_99),
[IFL 98](/papers/IFL_98),
[GFPW 98](/papers/Exceptions),
[RR 98](/papers/StdLib_98),

[HW 97](/papers/Haskell_97),
[HW 95](/papers/Haskell_95a),
[HW 95](/papers/Haskell_95b)),
1 open source project released,
1 open source project maintained.

## University of Glasgow Projects

I earned an [M.Sc. by research](/papers/MSc_93) in formal methods from the
University of Glasgow.


### Foreign Function Interface

I extended the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHCi)'s
garbage collector to better support
the foreign function interface,

1 paper published ([GFPW 94](/papers/GFPW_94)), contributed to 1 open source project.


### GUIs

I implemented a widget library for [Haskell](https://haskell.org/)
using the recently developed 'monad
programming' technique and an early version of Haskell's foreign function
interface.

1 paper published ([GFPW 93](/papers/GFPW_93)).


### GHCi

I worked on adding an interpreter to [GHC](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC)
and on allowing compiled code and
interpreted code to call each other.  This was not released at the time but
several years later, Julian Seward revived the idea although a new runtime
system was also being written at the time so I think the only part of the
original GHCi that survives is the name.  (Which is a shame because the name
doesn't really make any sense.)
