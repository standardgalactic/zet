  title     = {Evolving real-time systems using hierarchical scheduling and concurrency
               analysis},

  abstract  = { We have developed a new way to look at real-time and embedded
                software: as a collection of execution environments created by
                a hierarchy of schedulers. Common schedulers include those that run
                interrupts, bottom-half handlers, threads, and events. We have
                created algorithms for deriving response times, scheduling overheads,
                and blocking terms for tasks in systems containing multiple execution
                environments. We have also created task scheduler logic, a formalism
                that permits checking systems for race conditions and other errors.
                Concurrency analysis of low-level software is challenging because
                there are typically several kinds of locks, such as thread mutexes
                and disabling interrupts, and groups of cooperating tasks may need to
                acquire some, all, or none of the available types of locks to create
                correct software. Our high level goal is to create systems that are
                evolvable: they are easier to modify in response to changing
                requirements than are systems created using traditional techniques.
                We have applied our approach to two case studies in evolving software
                for networked sensor nodes.

  acceptance = {15},

  abstract  = { Design patterns are a valuable mechanism for emphasizing
                structure, capturing design expertise, and facilitating restructuring of
                software systems. Patterns are typically applied in the context of an
                object-oriented language and are implemented so that the pattern
                participants correspond to object instances that are created and
                connected at run-time. This paper describes a complementary
                realization of design patterns, in which many pattern participants
                correspond to statically instantiated and connected components.Our
                approach separates the static parts of the software design from the
                dynamic parts of the system behavior. This separation makes the
                software design more amenable to analysis, thus enabling more
                effective and domain-specific detection of system design errors,
                prediction of run-time behavior, and more effective optimization. This
                technique is applicable to imperative, functional, and
                object-oriented languages: we have extended C, Scheme, and Java with
                our component model. In this paper, we illustrate our approach in the
                context of the OSKit, a collection of operating system components
                written in C.

  title     = {FVision: {A} Declarative Language for Visual Tracking},

  abstract  = { Functional programming languages are not generally associated
          with computationally intensive tasks such as computer vision. We show
          that a declarative programming language like Haskell is effective for
          describing complex visual tracking systems. We have taken an existing
          C++ library for computer vision, called XVision, and used it to build
          FVision (pronounced ``fission''), a library of Haskell types and
          functions that provides a high-level interface to the lower-level
          XVision code. Using functional abstractions, users of FVision can
          build and test new visual tracking systems rapidly and reliably. The
          use of Haskell does not degrade system performance: computations are
          dominated by low-level calculations expressed in C++ while the
          Haskell ``glue code'' has a negligible impact on performance.

          FVision is built using functional reactive programming (FRP) to
          express interaction in a purely functional manner. The resulting
          system demonstrates the viability of mixed-language programming:
          visual tracking programs continue to spend most of their time
          executing low-level image-processing code, while Haskell's advanced
          features allow us to develop and test systems quickly and with
          confidence. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of Haskell and FRP
          to express many basic abstractions of visual tracking.

  title     = {Knit: Component Composition for Systems Software},

  abstract  = { Knit is a new component definition and linking language for
                systems code. Knit helps make C code more understandable and reusable by
                third parties, helps eliminate much of the performance overhead of
                componentization, detects subtle errors in component composition that
                cannot be caught with normal component type systems, and provides
                a foundation for developing future analyses over C-based components,
                such as cross-component optimization. The language is especially designed
                for use with component kits, where standard linking tools provide
                inadequate support for component configuration. In particular, we
                developed Knit for use with the OSKit, a large collection of
                components for building low-level systems. However, Knit is
                not OSKit-specific, and we have implemented parts of the
                Click modular router in terms of Knit components to
                illustrate the expressiveness and flexibility of our
                language. This paper provides an overview of the Knit
                language and its applications.

          FVision (Haskell). At the same time, our experience demonstrates how
          Haskell's advanced language features (specifically parametric
          polymorphism, lazy evaluation, higher order functions and
          automatic storage reclamation) permit a rapid DSL design that
          is itself highly modular and easily modified. Overall, the resulting
          hybrid system exceeded our expectations: visual tracking programs
          continue to spend most of their time executing low level
          image-processing code, while Haskell's advanced features allow us to
          quickly develop and test small prototype systems within a matter of
          a few days and to develop realistic applications within a few weeks.

  title     = {A Semantics for Imprecise Exceptions},
  acceptance = {20},

  abstract = {Some modern superscalar microprocessors provide only imprecise
              exceptions. That is, they do not guarantee to report the same exception
              that would be encountered by a straightforward sequential execution
              of the program. In exchange, they offer increased performance or
              decreased area (which amount to much the same thing).

              This performance/precision tradeoff has not so far been much explored at
              the programming language level. In this paper we propose a design for
              imprecise exceptions in the lazy functional programming language Haskell.
              We discuss various simpler designs, and conclude that imprecision is
              essential if the language is still to enjoy its current rich algebra of
              transformations. We sketch a precise semantics for the language extended
              with exceptions.

              From the functional programming point of view, the paper shows how to
              extend Haskell with exceptions without crippling the language or its
              compilers. From the point of view of the wider programming language
              community, we pose the question of whether precision and performance
              can be traded off in other languages too.  },

  title     = {Putting the Spine Back in the Spineless Tagless G-Machine: An Implementation
               of Resumable Black-Holes},
  abstract  = {Interrupt handling is a tricky business in lazy functional
               languages: we have to make sure that thunks that are being evaluated can
               be halted and later restarted if and when they are required. This is
               a particular problem for implementations which use black-holing.
               Black-Holing deliberately makes it impossible to revert such thunks
               to their original state to avoid a serious space leak. Interactive
               Haskell implementations such as Hugs and hbi catch interrupts and
               avoid the problem by omitting or disabling black-holing. Batch mode
               Haskell implementations such as HBC and the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
               (GHC) avoid this problem by disabling black-holing or by providing no
               way to catch interrupts. This paper describes a modification to GHC’s
               abstract machine (the Spineless Tagless G-Machine) which
               simultaneously supports both interrupts and black-holing.},

    title = {Handling Exceptions in Haskell},

    abstract = { Using a language without exception handling is like driving
        a car with no brakes and no seatbelt --- things work fine until
        something goes wrong. You also learn to drive rather carefully.
        This paper describes an exception handling extension to the Haskell
        lazy functional language. The implementation turned out to be very
        easy but we had problems finding a viable semantics for our system.
        The resulting semantics is a compromise between theoretical beauty
        and practical utility.
