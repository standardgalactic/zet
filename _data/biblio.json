Common schedulers include those that run interrupts, bottom-half handlers, threads, and events. We have created algorithms for deriving response times, scheduling overheads, and blocking terms for tasks in systems containing multiple execution environments. We have also created task scheduler logic, a formalism that permits checking systems for race conditions and other errors. Concurrency analysis of low-level software is challenging because there are typically several kinds of locks, such as thread mutexes and disabling interrupts, and groups of cooperating tasks may need to acquire some, all, or none of the available types of locks to create correct software. Our high level goal is to create systems that are evolvable: they are easier to modify in response to changing requirements than are systems created using traditional techniques.

This paper describes a complementary realization of design patterns, in which many pattern participants correspond to statically instantiated and connected components.Our approach separates the static parts of the software design from the dynamic parts of the system behavior. This separation makes the software design more amenable to analysis, thus enabling more effective and domain-specific detection of system design errors, prediction of run-time behavior, and more effective optimization.

We show that a declarative programming language like Haskell is effective for describing complex visual tracking systems. We have taken an existing C++ library for computer vision, called XVision, and used it to build FVision (pronounced ``fission''), a library of Haskell types and functions that provides a high-level interface to the lower-level XVision code. Using functional abstractions, users of FVision can build and test new visual tracking systems rapidly and reliably. The use of Haskell does not degrade system performance: computations are dominated by low-level calculations expressed in C++ while the Haskell ``glue code'' has a negligible impact on performance.  FVision is built using functional reactive programming (FRP) to express interaction in a purely functional manner. The resulting system demonstrates the viability of mixed-language programming: visual tracking programs continue to spend most of their time executing low-level image-processing code, while Haskell's advanced features allow us to develop and test systems quickly and with confidence.

The language is especially designed for use with component kits, where standard linking tools provide inadequate support for component configuration. In particular, we developed Knit for use with the OSKit, a large collection of components for building low-level systems.

It also illustrates the need for judicious interface design: relegating computationally expensive tasks to XVision (pre-existing C++ components), and leaving modular compositional tasks to FVision (Haskell). At the same time, our experience demonstrates how Haskell's advanced language features (specifically parametric polymorphism, lazy evaluation, higher order functions and automatic storage reclamation) permit a rapid DSL design that is itself highly modular and easily modified. Overall, the resulting hybrid system exceeded our expectations: visual tracking programs continue to spend most of their time executing low level image-processing code, while Haskell's advanced features allow us to quickly develop and test small prototype systems within a matter of a few days and to develop realistic applications within a few weeks.", "acceptance": "19", "pages": "484--493", "link": "http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=302405.302681", "editor": "Barry W.

This performance/precision tradeoff has not so far been much explored at the programming language level. In this paper we propose a design for imprecise exceptions in the lazy functional programming language Haskell. We discuss various simpler designs, and conclude that imprecision is essential if the language is still to enjoy its current rich algebra of transformations. We sketch a precise semantics for the language extended with exceptions.  From the functional programming point of view, the paper shows how to extend Haskell with exceptions without crippling the language or its compilers.
