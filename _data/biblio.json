Software Defined\nRadio (SDR) promises to deliver a cost effective and flexible solution by\nimplementing a wide variety of wireless protocols in software. In previous\nwork, a fully programmable multicore architecture, SODA, was proposed that was\nable to meet the real-time requirements of 3G wireless protocols. SODA consists\nof one ARM control processor and four wide single instruction multiple data\n(SIMD) processing elements. Each processing element consists of a scalar and\na wide 512-bit 32-lane SIMD datapath. A commercial prototype based on the SODA\narchitecture, Ardbeg (named after a brand of Scotch Whisky), has been\ndeveloped. In this paper, we present the architectural evolution of going from\na research design to a commercial prototype, including the goals, trade-offs, and final design choices.\n\nArdbeg\\textquotesingle s redesign process can be grouped into the following three major areas:\noptimizing the wide SIMD datapath, providing long instruction word (LIW)\nsupport for SIMD operations, and adding application-specific hardware\naccelerators. Because SODA was originally designed with 180nm technology, the\nwide SIMD datapath is re-optimized in Ardbeg for 90nm technology. This includes\nre-evaluating the most efficient SIMD width, designing a wider SIMD shuffle\nnetwork, and implementing faster SIMD arithmetic units. Ardbeg also provides\nmodest LIW support by allowing two SIMD operations to issue in the same cycle.\nThis LIW execution supports SDR algorithms\\textquotesingle  most common parallel SIMD execution\npatterns with minimal hardware overhead. A viable commercial SDR solution must\nbe competitive with existing ASIC solutions. Therefore, algorithm-specific\nhardware is added for performance bottleneck algorithms while still maintaining\nenough flexibility to support multiple wireless protocols.
