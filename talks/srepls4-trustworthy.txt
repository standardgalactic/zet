Preparing public release of ARM v8-A speciﬁcation
• Enable formal veriﬁcation of software and tools
• Public release planned for 2016 Q4
• Liberal license
• REMS group currently translating to SAIL
Talk to me about how I can help you use it

ARMResearch
CPU Speciﬁcations
Basis of a lot of formal veriﬁcation
Too large to be "obviously correct"
Reusable specs enable "virtuous cycle"
Greater effort to produce
Share testing / maintenance effort
More likely to be correct
Preparing public release of machine readable ARM Speciﬁcation
