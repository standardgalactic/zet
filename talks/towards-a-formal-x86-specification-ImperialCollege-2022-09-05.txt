About me                   https://alastairreid.github.io/papers/
@ Arm Research: 15 years
- Creating formal Arm ISA specification
- Formal verification of CPUs
@ Google Research: 2 years
- Software verification (Rust)
@ Intel Labs: 9 months
- Creating formal x86 ISA specification
Most projects I work on take 3-5 years to produce results

Our industry needs better ISA specs
For humans
- Clear, trustworthy, authoritative human readable specifications
For tools
- To verify hardware         https://alastairreid.github.io/papers/CAV_16/
- To verify (critical) software
- To check that (critical) software is secure?
- To verify compiler backends
- To build binary analysis tools (e.g., malware analysis)

How to write an ISA spec
Choose a language
-
Goal: industry standard for ISA specification
-
Arm's Architecture Specification Language
Write a specification
-
Based on existing documentation, simulators, etc.
Write lots of tools
-
Generate documentation from spec
-
Support development, migration, checking, ...

What makes it easy?
Done it before: experience + examples
Lots of testing collateral inside company
Recognized need and benefits
-
Multiple internal attempts
-
Successful external attempts (other architectures)

Motivating a company
Formally verify hardware
Validate simulators, firmware, microcode, ...
Support development of new architecture extensions
Move faster
Improve coherence across the company

What makes it hard?
Lots of testing collateral inside company
-
Need for extremely high quality
-
Need efficient bug triage tools
Must not accidentally change the architecture
-
But need to fix gaps, bugs, accidental ambiguities
Underspecification
-
Instructions allow a range of behaviors

Where are the research challenges? Part 1
Security
-
Can we detect security issues in new architecture extensions?
-
Can we say anything useful about side channels?
-
e.g., Formally specify things that can be observed and what can / 
cannot influence them?
-
Can we say anything useful about speculation, etc.?
-
Can we verify security of hardware against the spec?

I N T E L  L A B S  |  T H E  F U T U R E  B E G I N S  H E R E
Many, many security-related questions
Q: Is my software secure?
Q: Is my architecture secure? (See https://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2022/07/22/formal-cheri/)
Q: What security properties does my architecture satisfy?
Q: Can we verify security of hardware wrt the spec?
Q: Are those properties useful to software developers?
Q: Does change X to the architecture break existing security properties?
Q: What to do about side channels?
Q: What to say about transient execution?
Q: What about the rest of the chip?

Where are the research challenges? Part 2
Enabling novel tools    
https://alastairreid.github.io/uses-for-isa-specs/
-
Compilers: verify peephole optimizations?
-
Synthesis: generate peephole optimizations?
-
Analysis: malware analysis of binaries
-
Security: detect security vulnerabilities in binaries

How best to develop new uses?
Open source our specification
Open source our tools?
Collaborate with academia, etc.?
Blog posts?
Example code?
Tutorials?

Summary
Starting to build an official formal spec of the Intel Architecture
Industry standard around how we write ISA specs?
Still early days (which makes this a great time to start talking to us about your needs!)
Please talk to me about how I can help your research
(Obvious omissions from this talk: formally verifying x86 processors; weak memory model)
